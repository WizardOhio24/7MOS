        "abstract": "In 1985 23,000 people were killed by a volcano in Columbia; this is just one example of the many deadly eruptions that have occurred around the globe in living memory. I’m part of a team that is making sensors that can help to reduce the chance of more deaths like this in the future. We’re creating extremely accurate gravity sensors using the same techniques used to make mobile phone accelerometers.By scanning such sensors over the ground you can infer changes in density, and in doing so create images of magma flow; improving the ability to forecast hazardous events",

        "abstract": "Protons are a mini-universe in themselves — just like space looks different across different scales (we can see stars, galaxies, the Milky Way as we zoom further and further out), the inner world of the proton appears to change as we zoom further and further in. At a casual glance, it looks like it’s composed of three quarks, but peer deeper inside and it will have shape-shifted into a teeming sea of quarks and gluons. How do its properties come about? What gives it its mass, 1000 times greater than that of its quarks? And what microscopes can we turn towards the infinity of the small at the heart of the proton?",

        "abstract": "The Earth’s oceans were critical for the emergence of life. But our cosy nurturing planet was not always so. The Earth formed in a dry rocky region of our Solar System and so was initially a dry barren wasteland, a far cry from the pale blue dot we see today. Where our oceans came from has been a puzzle we’ve been trying to solve for decades. Now, with new analytical technologies, and fresh samples collected from the surface of asteroids we may finally have the missing piece of the puzzle to understand the origin of our blue planet.",

        "abstract": "The Nuclear Industry has received a lot of controversy regarding its safety, security and future development after the Fukushima disaster in 2011. Many countries are entering their nuclear decommissioning phase, marking a definitive end to the commercialisation of nuclear energy. However, the build-up of radioactive waste in nuclear stores remains a future burden. My talk will discuss the back-end fuel cycle issues, specifically the interim storage and permanent disposal stages, and suggest novel techniques to recycle and utilise the decay heat produced from radioactive waste for heat and/or electricity production.",

In this talk, I motivate our interest in dotted lines, discuss how our preferred line drawing method works, and finish with the underlying mechanical principles that allows efficiency in our dottyness. \n* For a given value of \"best\"",

        "title": "Jan 28 | A tale of fraudulent Scotch whiskies and the atom bomb",
        "abstract": "A major threat to the Scotch whisky industry is the sale of counterfeit single malt whiskies with purported distillation years in the 19th and early- to mid-20th centuries. However, these are often much more recent spirits, distilled in the latter part of the 20th or first part of the 21st centuries. These sales impinge upon the reputation of auction houses, retailers, brand owners and distillers.\n\n  The atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons in the 1950s and early 1960s caused a dramatic increase of radioactive 14C in the atmosphere. Using newly developed chemical techniques and accelerator mass spectrometry we have created a 14C calibration curve derived from known-age, single malt whiskies for the period 1950–2015 that enables whisky distilled during the period from 1955 onwards to have the distillation year determined to within 1–3 years for certain periods. However, because of the shape of the curve, two possible age ranges are often possible. The correct range can often be determined from a further plot of δ13C values against distillation year, which shows a trend of decreasing values through time. Examples are given of the determination of both genuine and fake products.",

NWs  of technologically important materials have been realized over past 3 decades which displayed interesting physical and chemical properties. These NWs enables futuristic applications such miniatured high speed computer processors, photonics devices, electron skin, energy generators etc., The production and processing of these NWs needs specialized techniques to realize the outlined devices and systems. This talk aimed to illustrate the technologically important NWs, focused processing techniques and few examples of demonstrated prototypes.",

        "abstract": " This research focuses on the enigmatic formation of Mars, its dynamic evolution & the origin of water on the red planet. Computational astrophysical experiments are performed to simulate the formation and evolution of Mars. We know that billions of years ago, Mars had abundant surface fluids & there is also evidence of current, transient fluid activity on the planet's surface. Ancient Martian rocks have been ejected form the planet's surface due to large impact events several times during the geological history & some, luckily, fell to Earth. These unique Martian meteorites help us reconstruct the formation of Mars, its ancient aqueous activity & assess its astrobiological potential.",

        "title": "Jan 28 | Helping to Prevent Strokes with Ultrasound",
        "abstract": "Strokes are the leading cause of disability in the UK and the second most common cause of death globally, whilst illness due to strokes is projected to double over the next 15 years. It is vital to identify individuals at high risk of having a stroke, so that they can be offered preventative treatment. Risk is currently determined by considering age, sex, and history of diabetes and various forms of cardiovascular disease, but the ‘thickness’ (viscosity) of the blood may be another important factor to consider. However, measuring the viscosity of blood typically requires bulky, high-powered equipment, which would make it unfeasible in low resource settings. It also needs several millilitres of blood to be taken, which could put people off from coming forward for screening. Therefore, we are developing a new method of measuring blood viscosity using surface acoustic waves (a form of ultrasound) that could be powered by portable batteries, and that requires much less blood.",

        "title": "Feb 4 | E-learning and how it can be diagnosed and nourished to become self-smart for the benefit of the learner, teacher and educational institution.",
        "abstract": "Today, the Internet is filled with a huge amount of learning resources. In all its forms, it includes audio, video, and a mixture of many forms represented by open education platforms. Both the teacher and the student are able to choose the source from which to feed the educational content they wish to learn. This trend rose to be more specialized and emerged as MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses). These platforms have opened the door for research in various areas to improve their performance to ensure that the best for the student, through the outstanding teacher, and the correct curriculum. The presence of such platforms, also opens the way for programmers to study the progress of the educational process and learn how to ensure the achievement of learning objectives open the scope for studying the various interactions that take place in these platforms. Some studies were able to analyze the learner's characters through mouse clicks and track the learner's movement with the educational content. Other understand the relevance of the learner to the course and his commitment to attend lectures and solve assignments in a timely manner. The increasing number of students enrolled in these platforms has given great attention to universities to go to this new trend of education. This posed a challenge to the transition to the cloud world with the same quality and educational controls in which all elements of education (student, teacher, educational course) are completely cloud based. So, programmers have been helping to find ways to enable these platforms to be smart enough to remove the difference between traditional on campus learning and online learning. In this work, we are developing a model that contribute to the analysis of the cloud learning, identify gaps and propose quality solutions. This can determine the programs needed for the  student to come up with certain skills and abilities. This contributes to the reorientation of the educational process in conjunction with the need of the student. Peering in mind that machine learning tools can help students to know their weakness and accordingly select the relevant courses to strength their skills and knowledge.",

However, the dream of an electron-free optical technology at the nanoscale relays on media with an efficient and ultrafast response in time to an optical perturbation. In this talk, I will show how to generate new light components by using time as a 4th dimension. By optically pumping the same material of the screen of your phone, I will provide a one to one efficiency conversion. What usually people do in kilometers of fibers is now possible in thicknesses thinner than your hairs.",
