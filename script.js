        "title": "Feb 19 | The Tiniest Things",
        "abstract": "Our theory of the fundamental building blocks of all matter, referred to as the Standard Model, is well-known to be incomplete. We don’t need to look very far to find tensions between the Standard Model and observations from experiment. For example, protons and neutrons clump together to form the nucleus of atoms, however they are actually composite in nature and our description of their constituents, quarks and gluons, raises many deep questions. It predicts a diverse ‘zoo’ of other composite particles and, by comparing observations of their properties with expectations from theory, we can evaluate the extent to which the Standard Model is valid. In my talk, I will describe ongoing efforts to pin down exactly the points of contention.",

        "abstract": "Early stage detection of bacteria for bloodstream infections is highly challenging due to the low bacterial counts, requiring lengthy culture steps to increase concentrations above limits of detection. We have developed a point-of-care testing strategy for detecting E. Coli from millilitres of whole blood. The method is based on the treatment of the sample with a mammalian-specific cell lysis buffer which enables to enrich E. Coli cells on a paper-based origami device. The bacteria are then detected by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) integrated in the device, reaching a detection limit of 10 3 cells/mL, a clinically-relevant concentration.",

        "abstract": "The planets of our Solar System formed from accretion of gas and dust in the nebula into protoplanets ~100 km across, giant collisions between these protoplanets formed the planetary system we see today. Many of these early planetesimals have since been disrupted and destroyed. However, we have fragments of some of these early planetary embryos in the form of the primitive achondrite meteorites. Through observations of the petrology and textures of these achondrites an understanding of the conditions and processes that were present on these early planetesimals can be inferred. Here use electron backscatter diffraction, a crystallographic mapping technique, to explore the mineral textures and microstructures in these achondrite meteorites in an aim to reconstruct their geological histories and gain an insight into the parent bodies they originated from along with what the early Solar System environment was like.",

        "abstract": "Increased electrical energy provision from clean sources is a vital aspect of the progressive decarbonization strategies adopted by different countries to protect the environment. Despite the growth of the solar energy sector, its utilization for energy provision has remained limited to hours of daylight. Consequently, its contribution to global electricity generation has been severely constrained. Solar radiation is a continuously available resource in space; harnessing this space resource for electricity provision opens a new vista of possibilities for delivery of clean energy services in an environmentally friendly manner. Space sector resources have contributed immensely to the advancement of the information and communication industry and to the understanding of the world but also holds enormous potential to significantly enhance the electrical power industry. The SOLSPACE project, supported by the European Research Council, aims to improve solar energy generation by using orbiting solar reflectors to direct solar energy from space to identified large-scale solar farms on the Earth thereby enhancing output at critical hours of the day; for example, at dawn and dusk when output is low or zero, but demand is high.",

        "abstract": "The natural world contains innumerable spectacular metamorphoses. The fast-swimming tadpole becomes the hopping frog, and the unassuming caterpillar becomes the dazzling butterfly. How can two forms of one organism with the same underlying genome look and behave in such radically different ways? To understand how these transformations are possible, we must look at DNA storage, histone proteins and the control of gene expression. This is the field of epigenetics. In humans, we know that epigenetic processes are controlled by three classes of enzyme: writer, reader and eraser. Of the eraser enzymes, histone deacetylases or HDACs are implicated in various human disease states – including HIV infection, Alzheimer’s and some forms of cancer. To combat this, we must understand how these enzymes function at a molecular level. In the Jamieson group, we are exploring the bases of HDAC substrate-recognition at the primary amino acid sequence level using rationally designed, synthetic histone tail peptides.",

I’m part of a team that is making sensors that can help to reduce the chance of more deaths like this in the future. We’re creating extremely accurate gravity sensors using the same techniques used to make mobile phone accelerometers.By scanning such sensors over the ground you can infer changes in density, and in doing so create images of magma flow; improving the ability to forecast hazardous events",

At a casual glance, it looks like it’s composed of three quarks, but peer deeper inside and it will have shape-shifted into a teeming sea of quarks and gluons. How do its properties come about? What gives it its mass, 1000 times greater than that of its quarks? And what microscopes can we turn towards the infinity of the small at the heart of the proton?",

The Earth formed in a dry rocky region of our Solar System and so was initially a dry barren wasteland, a far cry from the pale blue dot we see today. Where our oceans came from has been a puzzle we’ve been trying to solve for decades. Now, with new analytical technologies, and fresh samples collected from the surface of asteroids we may finally have the missing piece of the puzzle to understand the origin of our blue planet.",

        "title": "Jan 28 | A tale of fraudulent Scotch whiskies and the atom bomb",
        "abstract": "A major threat to the Scotch whisky industry is the sale of counterfeit single malt whiskies with purported distillation years in the 19th and early- to mid-20th centuries. However, these are often much more recent spirits, distilled in the latter part of the 20th or first part of the 21st centuries. These sales impinge upon the reputation of auction houses, retailers, brand owners and distillers.\n\n  The atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons in the 1950s and early 1960s caused a dramatic increase of radioactive 14C in the atmosphere. Using newly developed chemical techniques and accelerator mass spectrometry we have created a 14C calibration curve derived from known-age, single malt whiskies for the period 1950–2015 that enables whisky distilled during the period from 1955 onwards to have the distillation year determined to within 1–3 years for certain periods. However, because of the shape of the curve, two possible age ranges are often possible. The correct range can often be determined from a further plot of δ13C values against distillation year, which shows a trend of decreasing values through time. Examples are given of the determination of both genuine and fake products.",

        "abstract": "Strokes are the leading cause of disability in the UK and the second most common cause of death globally, whilst illness due to strokes is projected to double over the next 15 years. It is vital to identify individuals at high risk of having a stroke, so that they can be offered preventative treatment. Risk is currently determined by considering age, sex, and history of diabetes and various forms of cardiovascular disease, but the ‘thickness’ (viscosity) of the blood may be another important factor to consider. However, measuring the viscosity of blood typically requires bulky, high-powered equipment, which would make it unfeasible in low resource settings. It also needs several millilitres of blood to be taken, which could put people off from coming forward for screening. Therefore, we are developing a new method of measuring blood viscosity using surface acoustic waves (a form of ultrasound) that could be powered by portable batteries, and that requires much less blood.",

        "abstract": "Today, the Internet is filled with a huge amount of learning resources. In all its forms, it includes audio, video, and a mixture of many forms represented by open education platforms. Both the teacher and the student are able to choose the source from which to feed the educational content they wish to learn. This trend rose to be more specialized and emerged as MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses). These platforms have opened the door for research in various areas to improve their performance to ensure that the best for the student, through the outstanding teacher, and the correct curriculum. The presence of such platforms, also opens the way for programmers to study the progress of the educational process and learn how to ensure the achievement of learning objectives open the scope for studying the various interactions that take place in these platforms. Some studies were able to analyze the learner's characters through mouse clicks and track the learner's movement with the educational content. Other understand the relevance of the learner to the course and his commitment to attend lectures and solve assignments in a timely manner. The increasing number of students enrolled in these platforms has given great attention to universities to go to this new trend of education. This posed a challenge to the transition to the cloud world with the same quality and educational controls in which all elements of education (student, teacher, educational course) are completely cloud based. So, programmers have been helping to find ways to enable these platforms to be smart enough to remove the difference between traditional on campus learning and online learning. In this work, we are developing a model that contribute to the analysis of the cloud learning, identify gaps and propose quality solutions. This can determine the programs needed for the  student to come up with certain skills and abilities. This contributes to the reorientation of the educational process in conjunction with the need of the student. Peering in mind that machine learning tools can help students to know their weakness and accordingly select the relevant courses to strength their skills and knowledge.",
